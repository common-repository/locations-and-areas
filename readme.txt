== Description ==

=== What does it do? ===
An awesome map with features like: multiple regions as tabs, no API keys needed, frontend location adding, marker clustering & beautiful map and marker styles. 

=== If you want to focus on letting your visitors add markers by themselves check out my other more popular plugin Open User Map. It's based on this plugin but has a lot more features.===
[Open User Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/open-user-map/)


Look at the Demo and use-cases [here](https://www.locations-and-areas.com/). You can even add your own locations right away. Give it a try!

Showcase widely distributed locations on a single map with additional navigation tabs for regions. The map is based on [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) and offers you several free map styles. So you do not need an API Key, Access Token or any other external registration. There are no API request limits. 

Adding locations is as simple as dropping a location marker on a map. You can search for addresses worldwide to quickly find the right spots. Use the Gutenberg Block to integrate your map or place the shortcode anywhere on your site. Close by locations will group together in clusters. This is optional.

**üéÖ‚ú® The PRO Version now has a free 7-day trial period. No credit card required!**

=== Let your visitors "fly" back and forth between widely distributed locations with the additional area navigation ===
Make use of Areas (Regions) to provide different focus points to your visitor.

=== Your visitors can add locations directly inside the map (frontend) [PRO Feature] ===
Just by clicking a "+"-Button a form will popup to let them enter location details the same comfortable way you do it in the backend. After submit the location proposal will be "pending" and wait for your review approval to get published.

=== A possible use case: ===
You have offices in Europe, Asia and North America and don‚Äòt want to include a whole world map or three separate maps for that. This plugin let‚Äòs you set multiple focus areas within one map. Your visitors will switch (literally ‚Äùfly‚Äù) between your focus areas just by clicking the links on top of the map.

=== Another use case: ===
You have several stores in different cities. Your site visitors will be able to ‚Äùfly‚Äù between the cities to get an overview of the exact locations inside every city. You can set the zoom level for every area individually.

=== ...and another use case: ===
You want to build a map service where your visitors can add locations on their own. This could be a travel blog or a something like our [map with 500+ kite and windsurfing spots worldwide](https://surfspots.locations-and-areas.com).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need an API Key or some external registration? =
No, the plugin is based on Leaflet.js and offers you free map styles that don‚Äôt need any kind of registration.

Use the Gutenberg Block "Locations and Areas Map" or just place the shortcode `[locations-and-areas-map]` anywhere in your content or integrate it within your theme template with PHP:

`echo do_shortcode("[locations-and-areas-map]")`

you can also override the initial map focus with shortcode attributes:

`[locations-and-areas-map lat="51.50665732176545" long="-0.12752251529432854" zoom="13"]`

= Can I set the initial map position individualy? =

= Do I need GPS coordinates? =
No. Add a new location or define an area view simply by droping a marker on the map. You can search for addresses as well. If you want to use GPS coordinates though, there is an option for that.
